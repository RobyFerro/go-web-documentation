# Installation

## Standard installation

You can download and install Go-Web by following these steps:

* Download Go-Web release from [GitHub](https://github.com/RobyFerro/go-web)
* Extract the content in you project root
* Clone the `env.example` file in the root directory by naming it as .env
* Customize the server interface in `config/server.go` (optional)
* Download all dependencies by executing `go mod download` in project root
* Build CLI utility with `make build-cli`
* Execute `./alfred show:commands` to see all available commands
* Execute `make run` to runs the http server

## Docker

Go-Web provides a docker-compose.yml file that allows developers to easily set up a new development environment: this requires both Docker and Docker-compose installed on the development system.

:::tip
The docker-compose.yml defines several services, i.e. it is configured for providing instances of MySQL, Redis, MongoDB and ElasticSearch; if needed, instances of other services may be added by modifying the docker-compose.yml file.

| `make build-cli` | Builds the CLI utility |
