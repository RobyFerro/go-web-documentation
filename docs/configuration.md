# Configuration

All of the configuration structures are stored in the config folder.
You can create your custom configuration by adding a new structure in this package.

```go title="Custom configuration file"
package config

type CustomConf struct {
    Field1 string
    Field2 int
}

func CustomConf () *CustomConf  {
  return &CustomConf {
      Field1: "test",
      Field2: 1 
  }
}
```

Now you can retrieve your custom configuration by calling the `config.CustomConf()` method.

:::tip
You can encapsulate this method within a system service to propagate this instance within the http request lifecycle.
