# Service container

Service containers represent a powerful tool that injects dependencies into your application.
Methods executed there can access all the services registered in the specific service container.

To take advantage of this feature you should:

* Defining a new service
* Registering the service in a service container

## Defining a new service

All services have to be registrered inside the `service` package and implement a *factory* method that returns specific dependency type.

```go title="Defining the 'Redis' service"
package service

import (
 "fmt"
 "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/config"
 "github.com/go-redis/redis/v7"
 "github.com/labstack/gommon/log"
)

// ConnectRedis connect to Redis
func ConnectRedis() *redis.Client {
  conf := config.GetRedis()
  client := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
    Addr:     fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", conf.Host, conf.Port),
    Password: conf.Password,
    DB:       1,
  })

  _, err := client.Ping().Result()

  if err != nil {
    log.Error(err)
  }

  return client
}
```

The above example show uses how to define a new service. You can notice that the `ConnectionRedis()` method returns an instance of the `*redis.Client` type.
This is the type that will be automatically injected into our controller and commands.

## Registering the service

Before we can use the service we have to register it in the service container.
To do that we have to insert the method previously defined in the `foundation.BaseEntity` structure present in the `register` package.

```go title="Registering the 'Redis' service"
package register

import (
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web-framework"
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web-framework/register"
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/app/console"
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/app/http/controller"
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/database/model"
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/router"
  "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/service"
)

func BaseEntities() foundation.BaseEntities {
  return foundation.BaseEntities{
  // ... other entities ...
  Services: register.ServiceRegister{
   service.ConnectDB,
   service.ConnectElastic,
   service.ConnectMongo,
   service.ConnectRedis, // <- register the 'Redis' service
  },
  SingletonServices: register.ServiceRegister{},
  CommandServices: console.Services,
  // ... other entities ...
 }
}
```

As you can see the 'ConnectRedis' service may be registered in three different ways:

* Inside the `Services` field
* Inside the `SingletonServices` field
* Inside the `console.Services` strucure

### Services

Represent a service container that will be continuously regenerated. Every dependency registered in this container will be generated each time a request is made.

### SingletonServices

Service defined in this container persist across every requests. This is dependency are generated only once and then reused.

:::warning
Every consumer of the service must be aware of the fact that the service is a singleton.
:::

### CommandServices

Services defined in this container are executed only when the console is executed.
You can register a new service by implementing the structure `console.Service` present in the `console` package.

```go title="Registering the 'Redis' service in CommandServices"
package console

import (
 "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web-framework/register"
 "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/service"
)

var (
  // Commands is used to register all console commands.
  Commands = register.CommandRegister{}
  // Services will be used to create the Console Service Container.
  // This container is created to allow dependency injection through console commands.
  Services = register.ServiceRegister{
  service.ConnectDB,
  service.ConnectElastic,
  service.ConnectMongo,
  service.ConnectRedis, // <- register the 'Redis' service
  // ... OTHER SERVICES ...
  }
)
```

## Utilizzo dei container

Once you've defined your services you can use them in your application. You'll just need to define the type that is returned by one of our services as a parameter of:

* The `Run()` method present in a command
* In methods implemented in our controller.

```go title="DI inside a controller"
// Dependency injection in controller
package controller

import (
    "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web-framework" 
    "github.com/RobyFerro/go-web/database/model" 
    "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
)

type SampleController struct{
    gwf.BaseController
}

// Main controller method
func (c *SampleController) Main(db *gorm.DB) {
    // Il parametro `db *gorm.DB` è iniettato 
    // all'interno del controller tramite il service container
    var user model.User
    if err := db.Find(&user).Error;err != nil {
        gwf.ProcessError(err)
    }
}
```

```go title="DI inside a command"
package console

type Batman struct {
    Signature   string
    Description string
    Args        string
}

// Command registration
func (c *Batman) Register() {
    c.Signature = "command:signature"          // Change command signature
    c.Description = "Execute database seeder"  // Change command desc
}

// Command business logic
func (c *Batman) Run(db *gorm.DB) {
    // Il parametro `db *gorm.DB` è iniettato 
    // all'interno del controller tramite il service container
    var user model.User
    if err := db.Find(&user).Error;err != nil {
        gwf.ProcessError(err)
    }
}
```
