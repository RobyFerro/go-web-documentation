# Migration
Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to easily modify and share the applicationâ€™s database schema. 
Developers can creates new migration as follows:
```bash
$ ./alfred migration:up
```
Alfred generates new migrations in the `/database/migration` directory. 
You will find two different .sql files. Those files are similarly named except for the suffix. The `*_up.sql` is responsible for doing stuff on our database and the `*_down.sql` is responsible for rolling back our changes. You can simply write a pure SQL statement in each file.

## Execute migrations
Migration process handles only unexecuted migrations and can be start by running the following command:
```bash
$ ./alfred migration:up
```
This command runs the SQL statements present into every *_up.sql files.

## Rollback
If you need to rollback some changes you can always execute database rollback. 
```bash
$ ./alfred migration:rollback <steps>
```
Steps are meant as a migration batch. It means that you can choose to rollback one or more migrations simply changing the `steps` value.
