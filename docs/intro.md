# Introduction
Go-Web adopts a “convention over configuration” approach similar to frameworks like Laravel ,Symfony and Rails.

By following this principle, Go-Web reduces the need for “repetitive” tasks like explicitly binding routes, actions and middleware; while not problematic per se, programmers may want to adopt “ready-to-use” solutions, for instances if they want easily build complex services, aiming at a reduced “productive lag”.

Programmers may want to use existing frameworks like Gin-Gonic and Go Buffalo, but Go-Web differs from them because of the aforementioned “convention over configuration” approach.

## Disclamer
This project is still under development. Feel free to play with it but it's not ready for production.
